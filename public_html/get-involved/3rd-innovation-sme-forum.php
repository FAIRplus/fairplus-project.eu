                  <p>As part of the FAIRplus project, tools and guidelines have been developed to make life science data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), aiming to change the culture of data management in academia, SMEs and pharmaceutical companies.
                  </p>

                  <p>The third FAIRplus Innovation and SME Forum will bring together scientists and data experts from industry and academia interested in FAIRification of life science data. The goal of the event is to present the project's outcome and foster the development of an innovation ecosystem based on the FAIR principles.</p>

                    <h3 class="top-margin">During the event, we will:</h3>

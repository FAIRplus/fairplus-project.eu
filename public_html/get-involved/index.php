                  <p>There are several ways you can get involved in the FAIRplus project.</p>

                  <h2 id="fellowships">Fellowships</h2>
                  <p>FAIRplus will run a Fellowship Programme, which will include a structured learning curriculum and 'training-on-the-job'. After completing the programme, the fellows will be able to work independently as FAIR data advisors.</p>

                  <h2 id="byod" class="xx-top-margin">BYOD workshops</h2>
                  <p>The BYOD workshop will allow participants to implementing the FAIR standards and metrics with their own data. The workshops will use datasets and tools available and appropriate to the participants and to the FAIR readiness of the datasets. Tools will include those identified in the project (see <a href="/making-fair/">Making data FAIR</a>) but may also include other tools available to participants.</p>
                  <p>The workshops are aimed at different stakeholder groups e.g. data producers, consumers, service providers, technical experts, tool developers.

                                   <p class="top-margin">We will run three networking events the FAIRplus Innovation and SME Forums aimed at:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Biotech companies owning data potentially in need of FAIRification</li>
                    <li>Technology companies who are planning to provide FAIRification services</li>
                    <li>Academic groups interested in FAIRification for their data collections. </li>
                  </ul>


 <p><strong>The first FAIRplus Innovation and SME Forum was held on 29 January 2020 at The Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.</strong> See the <a href="/about/sme-forum-news">news release</a> and the <a href="/get-involved/SME-innovation-forum">event page</a>.</p>


                  <p>Each event will have 40-60 participants each in order to allow for ample interaction between event participants and FAIRplus participants. The timing of the events will be driven by the planned outputs of the project. The first event will ensure that large industries and SMEs can feed in their requirements to project participants. The other two events will provide hands-on access to the FAIR databases (where access restrictions allow) that have been implemented in the project. </p>



                  <p>These events will complement the BYOD activities (see above) and we will aim to co-locate both events where possible. The goal of these activities is to prompt new collaborations between the public and private sectors and to ensure that the impact to industry from the FAIRplus project goes beyond the partners engaged formally in the project.</p>

                        <h2 class="no-top-margin">What personal data we collect</h2>
                        <p>We collect the IP addresses of users. The site does not use cookies or collect any other personal data.</p>
                        <h2>IP addresses</h2>
                        <h3>What IP addresses are</h3>
                        <p>The FAIRplus website is on a web server, a type of computer that allows websites to be seen over the web. The web server collects the Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses) of the site visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that every device connected to the internet must have.</p>
                        <h3>Why we collect IP addresses</h3>
                        <p>Web servers log IP addresses by default so that errors on websites can be diagnosed, and so that malicious activity can be detected. They are important for the maintenance and security of websites, so that people can use the sites safely. Our justification for collecting IP addresses is therefore legitimate interest.</p>
                        <p>With the right software, you can identify the location of the IP address down to city level. Also, in some circumstances it is possible to put IP addresses together with other information in order to personally identify a user. It is for this reason that IP address are considered personal data under <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a>. However, <strong>we do not collect sufficient information to identify people from their IP address.</strong></p>
                        <p>The server is in the UK, and the IP addresses are not shared with any third party.</p>

                  <p>The FAIRplus Fellowship Programme is a comprehensive training programme in FAIR data management. <strong>The programme will run for a period of approximately 8 months, starting in April 2021</strong> and will guide its fellows through a series of modules combining online learning, 'training on the job' and short face-to-face meetings. After completing the programme, the fellows will have the confidence to lead, advise and initiate FAIR data processes in their respective companies and organisations.</p>
                
                  <h2>How to apply</h2>
                  <p>Most fellows will be selected from FAIRplus partner organizations (including EFPIA participants). Limited spaces are reserved for applicants from outside the FAIRplus consortium, in particular from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

                

                  <p>Interested candidates working in academia or EFPIA companies affiliated with the FAIRplus consortium or SMEs will be able to apply by submitting a FAIRification project they intend to develop during the Programme. Academic fellows will receive a small compensation fund for the time they spend completing the programme. <p>
                    
                  <p>As the programme's structure is currently being developed, the applications are not open yet. <strong>Register your interest by signing-up to our mailing list, we will notify you once we open the applications.</strong></p>

                  <h2>The Programme structure</h2>

                  
                  
                  <p>The programme is designed on the basis of the FAIRplus FAIRification Process and consists of a number of compulsory modules corresponding to the steps in the FAIRplus FAIRification process. In addition, there will be several elective modules open to all fellows interested in the content.  

                    <figure class="x-top-margin">
                      <img src="../images/FAIRification-process.png" alt="FAIRification process" class="fill" width="650px"/>
                      <figcaption>FAIRification process developed by the FAIRplus Squad teams.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                  <p class="x-top-margin">The modules of the FAIRplus FAIRification Process will be grouped into four phases:</p>
                    

                  <p><strong>The first phase</strong> consists of three compulsory modules and three elective modules. Each of these modules is delivered online and should be completed within eight weeks after the programme starts (May 2021). </p>

                     <p><strong>The second phase</strong> is a two-day workshop, which all fellows are expected to attend. During the workshop, participants will work in small groups and will have the opportunity to consult their project with FAIR data experts (members of the FAIRplus Squad teams, FAIR data managers and others).</p>

                    <p><strong>In the third phase</strong>, the fellows will work in pairs to explore interoperability and hosting requirements, and data sharing solutions in different settings. In each pair, the fellows will first assess the interoperability and hosting requirements in their own organisations and then individually arrange visits to their partner's organisations to learn about their specific situations. The collaboration will be supervised online by a FAIRplus expert who will be able to consult any issue or questions during this phase. At the end, each pair will write up their observations and preliminary solutions which will be presented in phase four.</p>

                    
                    
                    <p><strong>The phase four</strong> is a face-to-face meeting attended by all fellows. During the meeting, the fellows will present their FAIRification project results to demonstrate their understanding of FAIR data management and their capability of acting as FAIR data experts. At the end of the day, participants will receive formal certificates.</p>
